this package is for calculating:- 
1. Gaussian distributoin for given data set
2. Binomial distributoin for given data set

it also shows Histogram and graph representation.
to install type:-
--> pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ gaussBino-probability==0.1

For testing :- 
--> type python in terminal
1. import pakages
>>> from gaussBino_probability import Gaussian,Binomial
2. use this to find Gaussion distribution
>>> Gaussian(10,7)
mean 10, standard deviation 7

NOTE:-python version "3.6" or above
